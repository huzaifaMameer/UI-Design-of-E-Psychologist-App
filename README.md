# UI-Design-of-E-Psychologist-App
Project Description:
I successfully completed a UI design project for an E-psychologist platform within a two-week timeframe. Using the design tool Figma,
I conceptualized and created the user interface for the platform. 
This project involved understanding the unique requirements of an online psychologist service and translating them into a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
Throughout the process, I focused on creating intuitive navigation, visually engaging elements, and a seamless user experience. 
The project required attention to detail, effective time management, and collaboration with stakeholders to ensure the design met their needs. 
I delivered the final UI design,ready for implementation, within the specified timeframe, showcasing my ability to efficiently create high-quality designs in a timely manner.
